# A parser for dedimania.net

Dedimania is a PHP records database for trackmanmia public game servers. Unfortunately, this site is very old and cumbersome, hence it is invonvenient to navigate through it manually for longer periods of time.

## What this project does

This project extracts the amount of wins on rounds they played in a given month.

This allows the script to rank the players specified in logins.txt and have a competition each month, with a clear indicator of how many wins each player from logins.txt has this month.

### How to use

```bash
    ./setup.cmd; python main.py
```
